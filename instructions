# DogSlot V1.1 Setup Instructions

## 1. Dogecoin Core Setup

### 1.1 Install Dogecoin Core
If you haven't already, download and install Dogecoin Core from the official website: https://dogecoin.com/

### 1.2 Configure dogecoin.conf
1. Locate your dogecoin.conf file:
   - Windows: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Dogecoin\`

2. Open dogecoin.conf with a text editor. If it doesn't exist, copy the example dogecoin.conf file from the installation directory.

3. Add the following lines to enable RPC:
   ````
   server=1
   rpcuser=your_username
   rpcpassword=your_secure_password
   rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
   ```
   Replace `your_username` and `your_secure_password` with your chosen values.

4. Save the file and restart Dogecoin Core.

### 1.3 Update rpc.conf in the game directory
1. Navigate to the DogSlot game directory.
2. Open the `rpc.conf` file.
3. Update the file with the same `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` you used in dogecoin.conf.

## 2. First-Time Game Setup

### 2.1 Importing the Pool Wallet
When you run the game for the first time, it will automatically import the pool wallet into Dogecoin Core as a watch-only wallet without rescanning. This means:
- The pool balance will initially display as 0.
- You need to manually initiate a rescan to see the correct balance.

### 2.2 Rescanning the Blockchain
To see the correct pool balance:
1. Open Dogecoin Core.
2. Go to Help > Debug Window > Console.
3. In the console, type the following command and press Enter:
   ````
   rescan
   ```
4. Wait for the rescan to complete. This may take some time depending on your computer and the size of the blockchain.

After the rescan is complete, the correct pool balance should be visible in both Dogecoin Core and the DogSlot game.
